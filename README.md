# Car Resale Price Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the resale prices of used cars using various attributes such as Make, Model, Car Age, Mileage, and more. By applying machine learning techniques, we provide insights into the factors that most influence resale prices and offer strategies to optimize car pricing for dealerships.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Creation of new features such as Car Age and standardizing continuous features like Mileage and Engine Size.
Model Building: Training multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the best-performing model using Grid Search for Random Forest.
Insights and Recommendations: Analyzing feature importance to understand the key factors influencing resale prices and providing actionable recommendations for optimizing pricing strategies.
